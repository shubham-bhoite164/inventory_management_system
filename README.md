Inventory management helps companies identify which and how much stock to order at what time. It tracks inventory from purchase to the sale of goods. 
The practice identifies and responds to trends to ensure there's always enough stock to fulfill customer orders and proper warning of a shortage.
Once sold, inventory becomes revenue. Before it sells, inventory (although reported as an asset on the balance sheet) ties up cash. Therefore, too much stock costs money and reduces cash flow.

One measurement of good inventory management is inventory turnover. 
An accounting measurement, inventory turnover reflects how often stock is sold in a period. 
A business does not want more stock than sales. Poor inventory turnover can lead to deadstock, or unsold stock.

An inventory management system enables a company to maintain a centralized record of every asset and item in the control of the organization, 
providing a single source of truth for the location of every item, vendor and supplier information, specifications, and the total number of a particular item currently in stock.
